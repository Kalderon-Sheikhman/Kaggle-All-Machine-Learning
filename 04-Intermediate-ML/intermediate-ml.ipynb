    "## MISSING VALUES\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn three approaches to dealing with missing values. Then you'll compare the effectiveness of these approaches on a real-world dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways data can end up with missing values. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2 bedroom house won't include a value for the size of a third bedroom.\n",
    "A survey respondent may choose not to share his income.\n",
    "Most machine learning libraries (including scikit-learn) give an error if you try to build a model using data with missing values. So you'll need to choose one of the strategies below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1) A Simple Option: Drop Columns with Missing ValuesÂ¶\n",
    "Unless most values in the dropped columns are missing, the model loses access to a lot of (potentially useful!) information with this approach. As an extreme example, consider a dataset with 10,000 rows, where one important column is missing a single entry. This approach would drop the column entirely!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2)  A Better Option: Imputation\n",
    "Imputation fills in the missing values with some number. For instance, we can fill in the mean value along each column\n",
    "\n",
    "The imputed value won't be exactly right in most cases, but it usually leads to more accurate models than you would get from dropping the column entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3) An Extension To Imputation\n",
    "Imputation is the standard approach, and it usually works well. However, imputed values may be systematically above or below their actual values (which weren't collected in the dataset). Or rows with missing values may be unique in some other way. In that case, your model would make better predictions by considering which values were originally missing.\n",
    "In this approach, we impute the missing values, as before. And, additionally, for each column with missing entries in the original dataset, we add a new column that shows the location of the imputed entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, this will meaningfully improve results. In other cases, it doesn't help at all.\n",

    "Three Approaches\n",
    "1) Drop Categorical Variables\n",
    "The easiest approach to dealing with categorical variables is to simply remove them from the dataset. This approach will only work well if the columns did not contain useful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "Ordinal encoding assigns each unique value to a different integer \n",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/tEogUAr.png\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach assumes an ordering of the categories: \"Never\" (0) < \"Rarely\" (1) < \"Most days\" (2) < \"Every day\" (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption makes sense in this example, because there is an indisputable ranking to the categories. Not all categorical variables have a clear ordering in the values, but we refer to those that do as ordinal variables. For tree-based models (like decision trees and random forests), you can expect ordinal encoding to work well with ordinal variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "One-hot encoding creates new columns indicating the presence (or absence) of each possible value in the original data. To understand this, we'll work through an example.\n",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/TW5m0aJ.png\n",
    "In the original dataset, \"Color\" is a categorical variable with three categories: \"Red\", \"Yellow\", and \"Green\". The corresponding one-hot encoding contains one column for each possible value, and one row for each row in the original dataset. Wherever the original value was \"Red\", we put a 1 in the \"Red\" column; if the original value was \"Yellow\", we put a 1 in the \"Yellow\" column, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to ordinal encoding, one-hot encoding does not assume an ordering of the categories. Thus, you can expect this approach to work particularly well if there is no clear ordering in the categorical data (e.g., \"Red\" is neither more nor less than \"Yellow\"). We refer to categorical variables without an intrinsic ranking as nominal variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding generally does not perform well if the categorical variable takes on a large number of values (i.e., you generally won't use it for variables taking more than 15 different values).\n",
