In this lesson, we're going to learn how to interpret these learning curves and how we can use them to guide model development. In particular, we'll examine at the learning curves for evidence of underfitting and overfitting and look at a couple of strategies for correcting it.\n",

    "### Interpreting the Learning Curves\n",
    "You might think about the information in the training data as being of two kinds: signal and noise. The signal is the part that generalizes, the part that can help our model make predictions from new data. The noise is that part that is only true of the training data; the noise is all of the random fluctuation that comes from data in the real-world or all of the incidental, non-informative patterns that can't actually help the model make predictions. The noise is the part might look useful but really isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "We train a model by choosing weights or parameters that minimize the loss on a training set. You might know, however, that to accurately assess a model's performance, we need to evaluate it on a new set of data, the validation data. (You could see our lesson on model validation in Introduction to Machine Learning for a review.)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train a model we've been plotting the loss on the training set epoch by epoch. To this we'll add a plot the validation data too. These plots we call the learning curves. To train deep learning models effectively, we need to be able to interpret them\n",

(Whatever noise the model learned from the training set won't generalize to new data.) So, when a model learns signal both curves go down, but when it learns noise a gap is created in the curves. The size of the gap tells you how much noise the model has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would create models that learn all of the signal and none of the noise. This will practically never happen. Instead we make a trade. We can get the model to learn more signal at the cost of learning more noise. So long as the trade is in our favor, the validation loss will continue to decrease. After a certain point, however, the trade can turn against us, the cost exceeds the benefit, and the validation loss begins to rise.\n",

    "### DROP AND BATCH NORMALISATION\n",
    "###### Introduction\n",
    "There's more to the world of deep learning than just dense layers. There are dozens of kinds of layers you might add to a model. (Try browsing through the Keras docs for a sample!) Some are like dense layers and define connections between neurons, and others can do preprocessing or transformations of other sorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn about a two kinds of special layers, not containing any neurons themselves, but that add some functionality that can sometimes benefit a model in various ways. Both are commonly used in modern architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout\n",
    "The first of these is the \"dropout layer\", which can help correct overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson we talked about how overfitting is caused by the network learning spurious patterns in the training data. To recognize these spurious patterns a network will often rely on very a specific combinations of weight, a kind of \"conspiracy\" of weights. Being so specific, they tend to be fragile: remove one and the conspiracy falls apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the idea behind dropout. To break up these conspiracies, we randomly drop out some fraction of a layer's input units every step of training, making it much harder for the network to learn those spurious patterns in the training data. Instead, it has to search for broad, general patterns, whose weight patterns tend to be more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize how this works in the image below;\n",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/a86utxY.gif\n",
    "(Here, 50% dropout has been added between the two hidden layers.\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also think about dropout as creating a kind of ensemble of networks. The predictions will no longer be made by one big network, but instead by a committee of smaller networks. Individuals in the committee tend to make different kinds of mistakes, but be right at the same time, making the committee as a whole better than any individual. (If you're familiar with random forests as an ensemble of decision trees, it's the same idea.)\n",

    "##### Batch Normalization¶\n",
    "The next special layer we'll look at performs \"batch normalization\" (or \"batchnorm\"), which can help correct training that is slow or unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "With neural networks, it's generally a good idea to put all of your data on a common scale, perhaps with something like scikit-learn's StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler. The reason is that SGD will shift the network weights in proportion to how large an activation the data produces. Features that tend to produce activations of very different sizes can make for unstable training behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if it's good to normalize the data before it goes into the network, maybe also normalizing inside the network would be better! In fact, we have a special kind of layer that can do this, the batch normalization layer. A batch normalization layer looks at each batch as it comes in, first normalizing the batch with its own mean and standard deviation, and then also putting the data on a new scale with two trainable rescaling parameters. Batchnorm, in effect, performs a kind of coordinated rescaling of its inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often, batchnorm is added as an aid to the optimization process (though it can sometimes also help prediction performance). Models with batchnorm tend to need fewer epochs to complete training. Moreover, batchnorm can also fix various problems that can cause the training to get \"stuck\". Consider adding batch normalization to your models, especially if you're having trouble during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems batch normalization can be added at almost any  point in a neural network\n",

    "# BINARY CLASSIFICATION\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course, we've learned about how neural networks can solve regression problems. Now we're going to apply neural networks to another common machine learning problem: classification. Most everything we've learned up until now still applies. The main difference is in the loss function we use and in what kind of outputs we want the final layer to produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification into one of two classes is a common machine learning problem. You might want to predict whether or not a customer is likely to make a purchase, whether or not a credit card transaction was fraudulent, whether deep space signals show evidence of a new planet, or a medical test evidence of a disease. These are all binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your raw data, the classes might be represented by strings like \"Yes\" and \"No\", or \"Dog\" and \"Cat\". Before using this data we'll assign a class label: one class will be 0 and the other will be 1. Assigning numeric labels puts the data in a form a neural network can use.\n",

    "#### Accuracy and Cross-Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is one of the many metrics in use for measuring success on a classification problem. Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions: accuracy = number_correct / total. A model that always predicted correctly would have an accuracy score of 1.0. All else being equal, accuracy is a reasonable metric to use whenever the classes in the dataset occur with about the same frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with accuracy (and most other classification metrics) is that it can't be used as a loss function. SGD needs a loss function that changes smoothly, but accuracy, being a ratio of counts, changes in \"jumps\". So, we have to choose a substitute to act as the loss function. This substitute is the cross-entropy function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, recall that the loss function defines the objective of the network during training. With regression, our goal was to minimize the distance between the expected outcome and the predicted outcome. We chose MAE to measure this distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification, what we want instead is a distance between probabilities, and this is what cross-entropy provides. Cross-entropy is a sort of measure for the distance from one probability distribution to another.\n",
    "This is a visual representation of how CROSS ENTROPY WORKS.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/DwVV9bR.png\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that we want our network to predict the correct class with probability 1.0. The further away the predicted probability is from 1.0, the greater will be the cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical reasons we use cross-entropy are a bit subtle, but the main thing to take away from this section is just this: use cross-entropy for a classification loss; other metrics you might care about (like accuracy) will tend to improve along with it.\n",

    "#### Making Probabilities with the Sigmoid Function\n",
    "The cross-entropy and accuracy functions both require probabilities as inputs, meaning, numbers from 0 to 1. To covert the real-valued outputs produced by a dense layer into probabilities, we attach a new kind of activation function, the sigmoid activation.\n",
    "This is visually represented in the link below:\n",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/FYbRvJo.png\n",

    "To get the final class prediction, we define a threshold probability. Typically this will be 0.5, so that rounding will give us the correct class: below 0.5 means the class with label 0 and 0.5 or above means the class with label 1. A 0.5 threshold is what Keras uses by default with its accuracy metric.\n",
