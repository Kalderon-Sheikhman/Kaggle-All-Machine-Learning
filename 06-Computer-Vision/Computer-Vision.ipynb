    "\n",
    "The neural networks that are best at this task are called convolutional neural networks (Sometimes we say convnet or CNN instead.) Convolution is the mathematical operation that gives the layers of a convnet their unique structure. In future lessons, you'll learn why this structure is so effective at solving computer vision problems.\n",

    "We will apply these ideas to the problem of image classification: given a picture, can we train a computer to tell us what it's a picture of? You may have seen apps that can identify a species of plant from a photograph. That's an image classifier! In this course, you'll learn how to build image classifiers just as powerful as those used in professional applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our focus will be on image classification, what you'll learn in this course is relevant to every kind of computer vision problem. At the end, you'll be ready to move on to more advanced applications like generative adversarial networks and image segmentation."
