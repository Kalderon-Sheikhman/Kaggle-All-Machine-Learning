    "## A Guiding Principle of Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "For a feature to be useful, it must have a relationship to the target that your model is able to learn.\n",
    "Linear models, for instance, are only able to learn linear relationships. So, when using a linear  model, your goal is to transform the features to make their relationship to the target linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea here is that a transformation you apply to a feature becomes in essence a part of the model itself.Say you were trying to predict the Price of square plots of land from Length of one side. Fitting a linear model directly to Length gives poor results: the relationship is not linear.\n",
    "This is representated with a graph through this link:\n",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/5D1z24N.png\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we square the Length feature to get 'Area', we create a llinear relationship. Adding Area to the feature set means this linear model can now fit a parabola. Squaring a feature, in ther words, gave the linear model the ability fo fit squared features.\n",
    "A model with Area fitted is available here: https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/BLRsYOK.png\n",
    "\n",
    "This should show you why there can be such a high return on time invested in feature engineering. Whatever relationships your model can't learn, you can provide yourself through transformations. As you develop your feature set, think about what information your model could use to achieve its best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Concrete Formulations\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these ideas we'll see how adding a few synthetic features to a dataset can improve the predictive performance of a random forest model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Concrete dataset contains a variety of concrete formulations and the resulting product's compressive strength, which is a measure of how much load that kind of concrete can bear. The task for this dataset is to predict a concrete's compressive strength given its formulation\n",

    "First encountering a new dataset can sometimes feel overwhelming. You might be presented with hundreds or thousands of features without even a description to go by. Where do you even begin?\n",

    "The metric we'll use is called \"mutual information\". Mutual information is a lot like correlation in that it measures a relationship between two quantities. The advantage of mutual information is that it can detect any kind of relationship, while correlation only detects linear relationships\n",

    "    easy to use and interpret,\n",

    "Mutual Information and What it Measures\n",
    "Mutual information describes relationships in terms of uncertainty. The mutual information (MI) between two quantities is a measure of the extent to which knowledge of one quantity reduces uncertainty about the other. If you knew the value of a feature, how much more confident would you be about the target?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example from the Ames Housing data. The figure shows the relationship between the exterior quality of a house and the price it sold for. Each point represents a house.\n",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/X12ARUK.png\n",
    "\n",
    "From the figure, we can see that knowing the value of ExterQual should make you more certain about the corresponding SalePrice -- each category of ExterQual tends to concentrate SalePrice to within a certain range. The mutual information that ExterQual has with SalePrice is the average reduction of uncertainty in SalePrice taken over the four values of ExterQual. Since Fair occurs less often than Typical, for instance, Fair gets less weight in the MI score\n",
    "Technical note: What we're calling uncertainty is measured using a quantity from information theory known as \"entropy\". The entropy of a variable means roughly: \"how many yes-or-no questions you would need to describe an occurance of that variable, on average.\" The more questions you have to ask, the more uncertain you must be about the variable. Mutual information is how many questions you expect the feature to answer about the target.)\n",

    "Interpreting Mutual Information Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "The least possible mutual information between quantities is 0.0. When MI is zero, the quantities are independent: neither can tell you anything about the other. Conversely, in theory there's no upper bound to what MI can be. In practice though values above 2.0 or so are uncommon. (Mutual information is a logarithmic quantity, so it increases very slowly.)\n",

Just because a feature has a high MI score doesn't mean your model will be able to do anything with that information. You may need to transform the feature first to expose the association.\n",
